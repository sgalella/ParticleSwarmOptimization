# Particle Swarm Optimization
Implementation of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm proposed in [_Particle Swarm Optimization_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/488968) to find the global minimum in a landscape.

> _"PSO solves a problem by having a population of candidates of solutions, called particles, and moving these particles around in the search-space according to the particle's velocity and velocity"_ â€” From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization)
